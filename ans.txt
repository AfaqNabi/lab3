Q1: https://github.com/AfaqNabi/lab3.git
Q2: shows the default django startup page with docs
Q3: / shows a 404 and /polls shows the html in index()
Q4: A migration is used to tell the database to update our schema for the app i.e adding or updating models
Q5: I see two new models on the admin site, getting custome models to appear in the admin site we must register them in the admin.py file
Q6: when i enter the various routes the respective html shows up from views.py. if i put a string i get a 404 because django expects a int. to pass a string we can change the expected argument to a 'slug' type
Q7: because urls may change depending on where the app is deployed if domain changes or if your wokring in dev or prod environment
Q8: the benefits if using generic views in django is that you dont have to write boilerplate code that will be the same no matter what ur models argument
you should use generic views when your models are simple and that code can be abstarcted away. you shouldnt use generic views
when you need a high level of customization for your model with the client/sevrer interaction. for example if you need aggregate data from other services
