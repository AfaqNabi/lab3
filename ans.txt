Q1: https://github.com/AfaqNabi/lab3.git

Q2: shows the default Django startup page with docs

Q3: / shows a 404 and /polls shows the HTML in index()

Q4: A migration is used to tell the database to update our schema for the app i.e. adding or updating models

Q5: I see two new models on the admin site, To get custom models to appear on the admin site we must register them in the admin.py file

Q6: when I enter the various routes the respective HTML shows up from views.py. if I put a string I get a 404 because Django expects an int. to pass a string we can change the expected argument to a 'slug' type

Q7: Because URLs may change depending on where the app is deployed if the domain changes or if you working in a dev or prod environment

Q8: the benefit of using generic views in Django is that you don't have to write boilerplate code that will be the same no matter what your model's argument

you should use generic views when your models are simple and that code can be abstracted away. you shouldn't use generic views

when you need a high level of customization for your model with the client/server interaction. for example, if you need aggregate data from other services
